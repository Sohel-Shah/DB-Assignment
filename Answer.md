# 1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Ans : The relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" is a one-to-many relationship. Each product in the "Product" table belongs to exactly one category defined in the "Product_Category" table. This relationship is established through the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, which acts as a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This means one product category can have multiple products associated with it, but each product can only belong to one category.

 # 2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
 Ans : You can ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it by setting up a foreign key constraint. This means the "category_id" column in the "Product" table would be a foreign key that references the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that every value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must exist as an "id" in the "Product_Category" table. This constraint guarantees that any product category assigned to a product must already exist in the "Product_Category" table.
